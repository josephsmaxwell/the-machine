                Huge, huge thanks to Ali for being the best editor I could ever ask for. These three sentences are the only three she didn&#8217;t edit, so naturally they are the three worst sentences of the entire thing. Thank gopdness for her, this would have been really bad othrewise.

                Thanks to Tucker for inspiring me, and making me actually believe I could write this. It all goes back to when we were kids, riding bikes and talking about the universe. Also, he acknowledged me in his book so I kind of had to acknowledge him in mine.
